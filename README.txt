The purpose of this project is to enable data collection and eventually action to keep
plants alive in a garden.

This project encompasses five components:

1) The "Garduino" device itself, which manages the sensors and external controls

2) The Arduino software that's running on the device

3) A serial monitor that accepts serial (via bluetooth) data from the Garduino

4) A database to keep all of the data

5) A reporting application / system to let users manage the data
